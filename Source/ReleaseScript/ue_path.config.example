# ue_path.config.example
#
# Example configuration file for Unreal Engine path override
#
# Copy this file to 'ue_path.config' (same directory) and edit the path below.
# This file is gitignored and will not be committed to the repository.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy: ue_path.config.example -> ue_path.config
#   2. Edit ue_path.config with your UE base installation path
#   3. Run build scripts normally
#
# ============================================================================

# Specify the BASE directory where your Unreal Engine versions are installed.
# The build scripts will append the version (e.g., UE_5.7) to this path.
#
# Examples:
#   C:\Program Files\Epic Games
#   D:\Epic Games
#   E:\UnrealEngine
#
# All of these should have subdirectories like:
#   <your_path>\UE_5.7\Engine\...
#   <your_path>\UE_5.6\Engine\...
#   <your_path>\UE_4.27\Engine\...
#
# Note: Do NOT include the version folder (UE_5.7, etc.) in this path.
#       Do NOT add quotes around the path.
#       Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
#       Uncomment and modify the example below:

# C:\Program Files\Epic Games
