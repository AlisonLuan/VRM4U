# versions.txt.example
#
# Example configuration file for specifying which UE versions to build
#
# Copy this file to 'versions.txt' (same directory) and customize as needed.
# This file is gitignored and will not be committed to the repository.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy: versions.txt.example -> versions.txt
#   2. Edit versions.txt to enable/disable specific versions
#   3. Run build scripts normally (build_all.bat, build_5.bat)
#
# Alternative: Use BUILD_UE_VERSIONS environment variable
#   set BUILD_UE_VERSIONS=5.7,5.6,5.5
#   call build_all.bat
#
# ============================================================================

# Format: One version per line
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# Blank lines are also ignored
# Version format: X.Y (e.g., 5.7, 5.6, 4.27)

# UE 5.7 - Latest
5.7

# UE 5.6
5.6

# UE 5.5
5.5

# UE 5.4
5.4

# UE 5.3
5.3

# UE 5.2
5.2

# ============================================================================
# Platform Configuration
# ============================================================================
# By default, each version builds for specific platforms:
#   5.7: Win64 (Shipping), Android (Development), Linux (Shipping)
#   5.6: Win64 (Shipping), Android (Development)
#   5.5: Win64 (Shipping), Win64 (Debug)
#   5.4-5.2: Win64 (Shipping)
#
# Platform configuration is hard-coded in build_5.bat
# To change platforms, edit build_5.bat directly
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# Skip Missing Versions (Default Behavior)
# ============================================================================
# By default, if a version is not installed, the build script will:
#   1. Print a warning with the expected path
#   2. Skip that version
#   3. Continue building other versions
#
# To enable strict mode (fail if any version is missing):
#   set STRICT_VERSIONS=1
#   call build_all.bat
# ============================================================================
